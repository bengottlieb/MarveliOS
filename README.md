MarveliOS
=========

iOS wrapper for working with the Marvel API

- Very much still experimental, very easy to bust your rate API ceiling.




Instructions for Use of the Sample Project
--------------------


- Clone or download the .zip archive
- obtain a public and private API key from [Marvel](http://developer.marvel.com/account)
- copy these API keys into the MV_AppDelegate.m file (lines 23 & 24)


Using MarveliOS in Your Apps
----------------------------

I've not yet made this into a .framework, but if you want to use this in an app, just add the Core and UI folders (Core is required, UI is not) to your project.
